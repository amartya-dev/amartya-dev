# About Me

I am the elder of two brothers, I was born just two months after Mr. Amartya Sen received the Nobel prize which was the primary reason for my name being Amartya. I was in 1st standard when I got my first PC, that small piece of tech fascinated me a lot, I was completely hooked to it. I wanted to spend all my time with it, my mosi (maternal aunt) at that time was working with web design and she introduced me to basic HTML and software like DreamWeaver, PhotoShop, etc. 

The first-ever programming language I started was LOGO, I really enjoyed watching the turtle draw all sorts of shapes on the screen. I continued to explore whatever I could and that led to many early projects on my part. I used to help my mosi in her projects. I was also into classical Indian music and was learning to play some instruments as a hobby, the singers there wanted karaoke for tracks, that got me exploring software like Audacity and Adobe SoundBooth which I used to separate the tracks and remove the vocal sound making it a perfect karaoke. The real exposure I got was towards class 10 when I was working as a volunteer for an NGO, they needed a website made and that too on an urgent basis, I explored my options, experimented with stuff like WordPress and Joomla and made a website for them in under 2 weeks. At around the same time, I got introduced to Python and RaspberryPi, I started making my home lights switch on and off, started controlling my AC, and other electronic stuff with the help of this awesome little initiative called MIT App Inventor which allowed me to make minimal apps with Bluetooth, etc. in order to be able to control stuff remotely. My love for python and computer science grew exponentially, I made a train ticket reservation system using Tkinter for the GUI and basic stuff like file handling and Classes in Python as my 12 class project which received a lot of appreciation by my teachers. I decided to only take Computer Science as my branch for college.

I tried my hands with C++ and implemented B+ trees for my first year project but, the love for the simplicity and control that python offered made me come back to it, I started exploring anything that could be done in the language and that is when I started working on ML, DL and Django, I took up many projects through my professors, startup owners incubated by our university, etc and developed many web applications and DL models for them. I started participating in Hackathons and I received a prize in about 6 national level hackathons held at and outside my university.

This made me what I am today, I am a dedicated software developer with a keen interest in Machine Learning who loves to code and solve problems. I have been constantly working hard and taking up challenging projects to expand my knowledge base and apply myself to better serve society.

## Programming languages and frameworks I have worked with

Python, C++, Go Lang, Java, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, Django, Spring Boot, Dart, Flutter.
